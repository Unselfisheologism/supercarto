# Changelog

## 0.4.9

Tool-surface additions the benchmark repo needs (no behavior changes to
existing APIs):

- `src/diff/`: `diffDocuments` + `renderDiff` (benefit #5 implementation).
- Ingest `heat` member on feature collections (benefit #3 fixture support).
- `GraphNode.layer`: names the layer instead of generic feature labels.

Releases are cut from `master`. Benchmark-affecting changes are listed under
each release because a score is meaningless without the harness version that
produced it; every run archive records its commit hash for the same reason.

## Unreleased

- State-diff track, phases 1–2: `src/diff/` library, single-turn
  `synthetic-diff/diff` task. Multi-turn accumulation parked by design
  decision (agent harness's job, not the tool's).
- Heat track: ingest `heat` member, `synthetic-heat/heat` task.
- Expansion track, reformulated from containment (guessable) to footprint
  area (unguessable).
- Isolation: subjects run with a clean config home; tool detection matches
  `tool_use` events and nested MCP calls (voiding was inert before).
- Codenames retired from default models (`space-bunny`, `cat-jam`).
- Paperwork: `fixtures/bench/ATTRIBUTION.md` (ODbL answer),
  `croissant.json`, canary strings in all fixtures.

## 0.4.8

- Benchmark core per the SOP work list: frozen fixture truth, safe resume
  with prompt-hash guard, real call cap, run metadata, committed raw
  archives, 13-section datasheet with related work.
- Measured results (both official free models): omission/nearest/
  connectivity 9/9 supercarto vs ~4/9 geojson vs 0/9 none on the synthetic
  area; route/turn-by-turn unmeasurable (reference router returns impossible
  distances).
